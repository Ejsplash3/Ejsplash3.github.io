<p>Shale is a great drummer but I think he should up his a game so that he can become a professional drummer if he wants to be that. Shale is a great guy and a friend to be with. Shale likes to drinks arizona and eat poptarts all day. His best subject is science and might take that to a career.</p>

<p>If you be friends with Shale it will make you a better person. He is a great person to talk to and be with. Shale is a skinny guy who is kinda short and is a germophobic or you can say he likes his computer tidy. Anyone who reads this should go to Shales concerts and listen to him play. Also if any girls is looking at this webpage and likes a guy like this, plz ask him out because he is a great guy, and a tidy man which I know women like in a man.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
